🧭 NOTES FOR FUNCTIONALITY:
	•	No form on this page

❌ DO NOT:
<!-- DO NOT reuse the lead capture form here -->
<!-- DO NOT include “Join Waitlist” or Calendly buttons -->
<!-- DO NOT clutter with more CTAs — focus on gratitude and delivery -->
<!-- DO NOT show sourcing service details (save that for later emails) -->
✅ This is Step 2 in a funnel:
	•	Step 1 = Waitlist Landing Page
	•	Step 2 = This Confirmation / Bonus Delivery Page
