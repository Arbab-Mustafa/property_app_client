Please update the `CaseStudies.tsx` page by **replacing the existing placeholder case studies** with the real examples below.

⚠️ INSTRUCTIONS:
- ✅ Keep the current layout, style, and icons as-is
- ✅ Only replace the content in the `caseStudies = [ ... ]` array
- ❌ Do NOT alter any classNames, styles, or structure
- ✅ Fix IDs to match: strategy + location (no jargon like DPC)

Here’s the new case study array:

```ts
const caseStudies = [
  {
    id: "2-bed-social-housing-nelincs",
    title: "2-Bed Social Housing – North East Lincolnshire",

    strategy: "BRR / Social Housing",
