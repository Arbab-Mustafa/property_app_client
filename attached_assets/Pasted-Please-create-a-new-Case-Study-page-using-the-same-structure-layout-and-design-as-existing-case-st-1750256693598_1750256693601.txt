Please use these to create an auto-sliding carousel (same as previous case studies). Show them under the “Before” and “After” headings.

💬 Testimonial

I don’t currently have a testimonial for this deal. Please insert a placeholder styled like other pages:

“This was my first hands-off social housing deal and it ran smoother than expected.”
— Placeholder, Investor

✅ CTA + Lead Magnet
At the bottom of the page, keep the same structure:
	•	Primary CTA: Book a Free Call
	•	Beneath that:
“Not ready yet? Download our Deal Checklist to learn what makes a deal compliant + profitable.”
Include email opt-in form that connects to SendGrid and Baserow like previous pages.

Do not change any branding, spacing, or layout. Please match all styles (colors, paddings, fonts) to the existing case studies page. Let me know when it’s live.
