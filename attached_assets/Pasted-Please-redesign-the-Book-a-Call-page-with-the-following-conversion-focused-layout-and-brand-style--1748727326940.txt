Please redesign the Book a Call page with the following conversion-focused layout and brand style.

Do not remove or break any existing backend or scheduling logic (e.g. Calendly). This is a design/layout enhancement only.

🎨 Brand Colors:
- Primary Accent: #F97316 (Orange)
- Trust Blue: #1A355E (Navy)
- Neutral Text: #6B7280 (Cool Grey)
- Background: #F9FAFB (Off-White)
- Highlight: #C58B25 (Muted Gold)

🧱 PAGE STRUCTURE:

1. 💬 HEADER
- Headline (centered, bold, navy):
  → “Book a Free Strategy Call to Learn How Our Investors Are Beating Inflation with UK Property”
  → Use `text-3xl md:text-4xl font-bold text-center text-[#1A355E] mt-10 mb-4`

- Subheadline (smaller, cool grey, centered):
  → “In just 15 minutes, discover how you could earn 8–12% returns annually — secured against real property, and without becoming a landlord.”
  → Use `text-lg text-center text-[#6B7280] mb-8 max-w-2xl mx-auto`

2. 📅 CALL TO ACTION (Stacked on mobile, side-by-side on desktop)
- Left: Calendly button (styled as CTA)
  → “🟠 Book My Free Call” (bg: orange, white text, hover: darker orange)

- Right: Secondary CTA with icon
  → “📞 Prefer to speak now? Call us directly: [insert phone number]”
  → Style as a soft link or small button

3. ✅ WHY BOOK A CALL WITH US? (Bulleted List, centered)
- Use checkmark icons and bold text
  ✔️ Discover how to make your money work harder
  ✔️ See how others earn passive returns backed by property
  ✔️ No pressure — just clear numbers and options
  ✔️ Just 15 minutes to rethink your financial path

4. 🎯 SOFT CTA (for hesitant users)
- Text block with:
  → “Not ready to talk? Try our [Free Inflation Calculator] to see how much your money is losing sitting in the bank.”
  → Link styled with muted gold hover effect

5. 🧠 TRUST TESTIMONIAL (Centered box, off-white background)
→ Quote:
  “After just one call, I felt confident investing. Now I’m earning 10% and sleeping better at night.”
  — Sarah R., Private Lender
→ Style:
  Italic, cool grey text, quote marks or icon, max-width card with light border

📱 RESPONSIVE NOTES:
- Stack CTAs and bullet sections on mobile
- Ensure all buttons are tap-friendly
- Use `max-w-3xl mx-auto` to constrain layout width and keep things clean

🛠️ DO NOT:
- Alter Calendly embed or remove backend functionality
- Modify form logic, post-submit behavior, or SendGrid setup

The goal is a clean, clear, and confident landing page that builds trust and encourages conversions.
