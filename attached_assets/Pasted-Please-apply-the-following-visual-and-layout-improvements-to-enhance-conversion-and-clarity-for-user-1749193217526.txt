Please apply the following visual and layout improvements to enhance conversion and clarity for users. This is a continuation of the previous request — keep the existing headline and urgency banner exactly as is.

🎨 Brand Theme (Reconfirm):
- Orange CTA: #F97316
- Navy Headings: #1A355E
- Cool Grey Body Text: #6B7280
- Background: #F9FAFB
- Highlight (CTA/secondary): #C58B25

📌 ADDITIONAL VISUAL IMPROVEMENTS TO MAKE:

1. **CTA Button Styling** (for “Reveal My Losses” button):
   - Use Orange (#F97316), white text, large padding (`px-6 py-3`)
   - Rounded edges (`rounded-lg`)
   - On hover: slight darkening or drop shadow

2. **Calculator Form Container**
   - Wrap the entire form in a card-style container
   - Background: #FAF9F6
   - Add padding, light shadow, and rounded corners
   - Give the section breathing room with `py-10`

3. **Add Visual Icon or Decorative Indicator**
   - Insert a small visual near the calculator form (e.g., shrinking pound symbol or red downward arrow)
   - Icon color: Orange or Muted Gold
   - Use SVG or lightweight image

4. **Improve Section Spacing**
   - Ensure each section has `py-8` or `py-12` spacing
   - Keep the layout scannable and well-structured

5. **Add Testimonial Block**
   - Below the calculator or result preview, add a bordered card with this quote:
     “I had no idea I was losing that much — now I’m earning 10% instead.” – James, Private Investor
   - Style: Italic, Cool Grey text, background: very light grey, subtle border

6. **Post-Submit Call to Action**
   - Below the results (after form is submitted), add:
     “Want to protect your savings and earn more? Book a free strategy call.”
   - Add secondary CTA button:
     → Text: “Book My Free Call”
     → Button color: Muted Gold (#C58B25), white text, rounded

7. **Mobile Optimization**
   - Ensure all elements stack vertically on small screens
   - Buttons must be large enough to tap
   - Maintain padding and readability

🛠️ TECH CAUTION:
- DO NOT break or change the SendGrid email logic
- DO NOT alter any calculator formulas or submission fields
- Use TailwindCSS or minimal utility classes to implement styles cleanly
