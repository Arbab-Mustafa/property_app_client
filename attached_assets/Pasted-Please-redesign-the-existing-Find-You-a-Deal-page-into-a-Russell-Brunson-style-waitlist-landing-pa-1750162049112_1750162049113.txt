Please redesign the existing “Find You a Deal” page into a Russell Brunson–style waitlist landing page for a paused service.

The page should focus on scarcity, trust, and lead capture — while offering a valuable bonus (a free deal checklist) as the opt-in incentive.

🔥 STRUCTURE + CONTENT TO INCLUDE:

1. 🧲 **Hero Headline (Big + Bold)**
Text:
“Our Deal Sourcing Service Is Currently Paused — But You Can Still Get on the Waitlist.”

2. 💬 **Subheadline (clarify situation + benefit)**
Text:
“We’re at full capacity — but when a spot opens, you’ll be the first to know. Plus, get our free Deal Checklist to prepare like a pro.”

3. 🎁 **Lead Magnet Banner / Section**
Style as a highlighted card or banner block:
Title: “The Ultimate Deal Checklist for Property Investors”
Include 3–5 short bullet points:
• Know what to ask before buying  
• Spot hidden costs and deal-breakers  
• 10 due diligence checks most investors skip  
• Instantly compare ROI across deals  

Include an icon (checklist, folder, or clipboard).

“Get the Checklist + Join the Waitlist”  
→ Large, rounded, bright orange (#F97316) with white text  
→ Hover: slightly darker orange

🚫 DO NOTs (VERY IMPORTANT):
<!-- DO NOT clutter with too many CTAs – ONE action per page -->
<!-- DO NOT use long paragraphs – use bullet points for clarity -->
<!-- DO NOT link to Calendly or book a call -->
<!-- DO NOT show case study grid or detailed deals -->
<!-- DO NOT mention active sourcing or onboarding -->

✅ The ONLY goal of this page:  
→ Build anticipation + grow the waitlist  
→ Deliver a valuable freebie to build trust  

Keep the layout clean, modern, mobile-first, and emotionally persuasive.
