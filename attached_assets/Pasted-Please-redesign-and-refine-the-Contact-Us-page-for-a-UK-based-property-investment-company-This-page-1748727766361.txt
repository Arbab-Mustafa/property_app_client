Please redesign and refine the Contact Us page for a UK-based property investment company. This page should speak directly to private investors, JV partners, and deal sourcers — not general inquiries.

🎯 Tone: Clear, professional, and trust-building
🎨 Styling: Match brand palette — off-white background (#F9FAFB), trust navy (#1A355E), soft gold accents (#C58B25)

🔧 Replace existing text and structure with:

1. 🟦 Hero Section:
Headline:
“Start the Conversation About Making Your Money Work Smarter”
→ Bold, centered, navy blue (#1A355E), font size `text-3xl md:text-4xl`

Subheadline:
“Whether you’re looking to earn passive income through secured property lending, co-invest on a project, or just want access to high-performing deals — we’re here to help. Drop us a message and we’ll get back to you within 1 working day.”
→ Style as `text-lg text-gray-600 max-w-2xl mx-auto text-center mb-6`

2. 🧠 Trust Badge Section (below intro, optional small font with icons):
- “🔒 All investments secured against UK property”
- “£1.2M+ raised from private investors”
- “100+ property transactions since 2017”
